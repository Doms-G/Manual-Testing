# 🧪 Manual Testing Portfolio

Welcome to my QA lab! 👩‍🔬
This repository showcases my manual testing work — from detailed test cases and bug reports to exploratory notes and testing checklists. Whether you're a fellow tester, recruiter, or curious dev, feel free to poke around!

## 📂 What’s Inside

- 📋 **Test Plans** – Structured outlines of what to test, how, and when
- ✅ **Test Cases** – Step-by-step scenarios to verify functionality
- 🔗 **RTM (Requirements Traceability Matrix)** – Maps test cases to requirements
- 🐞 **Bug Reports** – Clearly documented defects with expected vs actual results
- 🔍 **Exploratory Testing Notes** – Where I click all the wrong things… on purpose.
- 🧠 **Checklists** – Sanity-saving lists to keep testing consistent

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used

### 🧈 Manual Testing – My QA bread and butter  
- **Functional Testing** – Checking if features work as intended  
- **UI/UX Testing** – Spotting awkward flows and pixel shifts  
- **Regression Testing** – Making sure fixes don’t break old stuff  
- **Smoke/Sanity Testing** – Quick checks before diving deep  

### 🐛 Bug Reporting – Writing defects developers can actually use  
- **Clear Steps to Reproduce** – So devs don't guess what went wrong  
- **Expected vs Actual Results** – For immediate context  
- **Screenshots / Recordings** – Because visual evidence saves time  
- **Severity & Priority Tags** – To help triage like a pro  

### 📝 Test Design Techniques  
- **Equivalence Partitioning** – Test one from each group, not everything  
- **Boundary Value Analysis** – Focus near edges where bugs love to hide  
- **Decision Table** – Map complex rules into simple rows  
- **Error Guessing** – Years of breaking things pays off here  

### 🗃️ Test Documentation via  
- **Google Sheets / Excel** – For structured, scalable test case management  
- **Google Docs / Word** – For detailed test plans and checklists  
- **Jira** – For tracking bugs, sprint tasks, and occasionally reminding devs that “yes, it’s *still* broken” 😄  

### 🖥️ Platforms Tested  
- **Web Applications** – Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge  
- **Mobile Browsers** – Android Chrome, iOS Safari  
- **Operating Systems** – Windows, macOS  
- **UI Prototypes** – Like Figma, to test ideas before they’re real
